If you were admitted provisionally, you owe outstanding documents to the Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations (GAPE) Office to complete your admission process. Visit your MySJSU To-Do list to identify the required documents to clear your provisional status. If you have any questions about the outstanding document, please contact the GAPE Evaluator for your program for further assistance. The GAPE Office determines the provisional admission; therefore, your graduate program department cannot remove this status. If a provision is not cleared by the date specified on the MySJSU To-Do list, you will not be able to register for the upcoming semester.',\n",

              "  \"Title: Follow University Registration Processes\\nDescription: The Office of the Registrar is responsible for registration, grades, verification of enrollment and degree, official transcripts, reinstatement, and other student record functions. As a graduate student, it is crucial to know key registration steps, deadlines, and forms. Visit the Registrar's Office website to gain knowledge about the university's registration processes. Review the Academic Calendar to stay informed of any upcoming university dates. For additional assistance, review the following Registration Notes. Course Prerequisites: If a student has taken a prerequisite course outside of SJSU, they will need to submit an unofficial transcript to the course instructor. The instructor can issue a permission number to enroll in the course. Undergraduate Classes: Graduate students may take undergraduate classes. However, lower division (freshman and sophomore) courses numbered 1-99 cannot be used for graduate degree credit and are not included in the GPA computation. One Semester Leave: Graduate students may take one semester off without reapplying to the University. Summer is not considered a semester. For example, if you do not register in the Spring semester, you would need to register the following Fall semester to maintain your enrollment. *If students have completed coursework and are still working on their culminating experience, they are no longer permitted to take a semester leave; instead, culminating graduate students are required to maintain continuous enrollment each semester (Fall and Spring) until degree completion.\",\n",

Therefore, a maximum of 9 units may be transferred into a 30-unit program from all sources. To review the complete policy, please visit the Transfer Credit section under Graduate Policies in the Academic Catalog. Transfer credit can be awarded by the Graduate Program Coordinator for post-baccalaureate courses taken at another university, as long as the courses were not counted for degree credit, or for graduate-level courses taken during the senior year as an SJSU undergraduate (final two undergraduate semesters) if the courses did not contribute to the bachelor degree. Students must request to have transfer credits validated. If an advanced evaluation is not necessary, transfer courses may simply be listed on your candidacy form [pdf] (Section C) and pending approval, will be processed upon submission of your department approved candidacy form. For students requesting an advanced evaluation of transfer credits, you must first submit the following to your designated Graduate Program Coordinator for approval: Once your request has been approved by your program department, the completed form must be routed online to the Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations (GAPE) Office. The GAPE Office must have official transcripts in order to finalize the transfer process. Unless already on file, sealed official copies of transcripts be mailed to: Graduate Admissions and Program EvaluationsSan Jose State UniversityOne Washington SquareSan Jose, CA 95192-0017 Or requested to be sent electronically to: etranscript@sjsu.edu.

Students who were admitted conditionally classified have prerequisites that they must complete as outlined in their admission letter from SJSU. These prerequisites must be fulfilled prior to Advancement to Graduate Candidacy. If you have any questions on the prerequisites listed on your admissions letter, please contact your Graduate Program Coordinator. Once you have fulfilled all prerequisites outlined in your admission letter, make sure you notify your Graduate Program Coordinator and submit all required documentation to your graduate department. Your Graduate Program Coordinator will notify the Graduate Admissions and Program Evaluations (GAPE) Office that your status should be changed from conditional to classified status via one of two forms: 1. Change in Classification in Master's Program: Graduate Program Coordinators submit the change of classification form to GAPE, indicating that all student admission conditions have been fulfilled, allowing the student's conditional status to be lifted and establishing the classified status. 2. Petition for Advancement to Graduate Candidacy [pdf]: The Graduate Program Coordinator's signature on the candidacy form indicates that the Graduate Program Coordinator has checked that all conditions have been fulfilled, allowing the student's conditional status to be lifted and establishing the classified status. Graduate Program Coordinators do not need to submit the Change in Classification in Master  Program form to GAPE. Note: Do not list your pre-requisites on your candidacy form. Submission of a Graduate Program Coordinator approved candidacy form indicates that pre-program requirements have been fulfilled. The candidacy form should only include program requirements.\",\n",

New or Current Students After you have been admitted to SJSU, if you want to change your nonimmigrant status to F-1, we recommend that you plan ahead. Below is a summary of available options. If you are admitted to SJSU in your current nonimmigrant status, such as H-4, F-2, E-2, L-2, etc., it is your responsibility to know if you can study in your current status. See this ICE handout Nonimmigrants: Who Can Study. If you have not been admitted to SJSU, please wait until you have been officially accepted by the University and received your admit letter before applying for a change of status. ISSS does not provide admission counseling or advice. Per University policy, non-resident tuition fees are charged from the I-20 issuance date. Ways to obtain F-1 status. View this Comparison Chart. By Travel or Consular processing. You will need to depart the U.S., apply for an F-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, preferably in your home country. Fill out and submit a Change of Status I-20 Request form to ISSS. Apply for an F-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad. To re-enter the U.S. apply for F-1 admission at a U.S. Port of Entry. You will need to enter within 30 days of the program start date listed on your I-20. File Form I-539, Change of Status application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Fill out and submit a Change of Status I-20 Request form to ISSS. Prepare and submit your Form I-539 COS application to USCIS along with a copy of the COS I-20 and supporting documentation. See USCIS or Study in the States website for more COS to F-1 information. Check USCIS Processing Time for Form I-539s here. Students filing a COS application with USCIS have the option to file for Premium Processing at the time of application or by adding it to their pending application (by filing the I-907). USCIS will take adjudicative action within 30 days or will refund Premium Processing fee. Processing Time Questions to consider: How soon do you want to become an F-1 student? When did you start your academic program? Are you in the first semester of your degree program or near the end of your program? Changing your nonimmigrant status to F-1 status will take time. Depending on the route you select, you will need to plan ahead. Expect delays either with obtaining your F-1 visa stamp, or you may experience prolonged COS processing times with USCIS. ISSS highly recommends that you start the change of status process early in your academic career, optimally with at least two semesters or more remaining in your degree program. Financial implications. Are you currently eligible for in-state tuition or have an exemption/exception to payment of non-resident tuition? All F-1 students pay the non-resident tuition rate. Per University policy, non-resident tuition fees are charged from the I-20 issuance date. In addition, F-1 students are required to purchase University-sponsored health insurance. You will need to factor in any travel costs in and out of the U.S. and visa application fee(s) if you choose the consular processing option. Alternatively, if you choose the USCIS option, consider the filing fee for Form I-539 Change of Status, plus biometrics, or additional fee(s). Intent or Motivation. Are you willing to pursue full-time studies? F-1 students are required to be enrolled in a full course of study during the academic year. Off-campus work benefits such as Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical Training are not guaranteed and should not be the primary reason(s) for you to convert to F-1 student status. Application Steps Fill out and submit a Change of Status I-20 Request form to ISSS. Indicate which option you will pursue to convert to F-1 status. Allow at least 15 business days for processing. We will contact you when the I-20 is ready. Financial documentation See the Declaration of Finance form for the required funding amounts and acceptable funding sources. Bank letters or statements must be dated within the past six months, must be in English, balance listed in U.S. dollars. For the USCIS COS application, we recommend you submit additional 3-4 consecutive bank statements with a monthly balance in the required amount. Current immigration documents Copy of your passport, visa, and I-94 record of arrival Copy of the principal visa holder passport, visa, I-94, or Form I-797A Notice of Action, if applicable Admit Letter If you have already started your studies at SJSU, provide a letter from your graduate advisor or an individualized academic or program plan with the expected graduation or degree completion date. This will determine your I-20 program end date. After you have received your I-20, check for any errors, sign, and date the document. Prepare and gather your remaining paperwork depending on the option below: Checklist for Consular Processing Checklist for USCIS Change of Status Deadline to request an I-20. No matter which option you choose, understand that converting to F-1 student status takes time. There are many steps for you to complete. Commit to one option. Plan ahead. Expect travel or visa application-related delays or longer processing times at USCIS. ISSS cannot guarantee you an F-1 visa or a change of status to F-1 approval within your preferred timeline. You must maintain your current nonimmigrant status to be eligible to remain in the U.S. Have a contingency plan in the event that your change of status or your F-1 visa is not approved. Requested F-1 Start Date Fall Semester No later than July 15 Spring Semester No later than December 15 Employment If you are interested in learning about the employment options available to F-1 students, select On-Campus, Curricular Practical Training, or Optional Practical Training under the Current Students tab on the ISSS website. Keep in mind that you must be in valid F-1 status to benefit from the employment options for students. For off-campus employment (CPT, OPT) there is the additional requirement of completing one academic year of full-time studies. Please refrain from inquiring about CPT or OPT work authorization or be in the process of applying for jobs if you do not have the proper F-1 status yet.',\n",

              "  \"Title: Basics\\nDescription: \\nInterviewing Basics\\nCongratulations! You impressed the employer with your experience and skills and now have an opportunity  to interview with the employer. Interviews may occur on the phone, at the employer site, at a job fair,   or virtually. But no matter where they occur, preparation is the key to success.\\nBig Interview is an online tool available to SJSU students. It will help you review , practice, and record hundreds of practice interview questions from various industries. Register at sjsu.biginterview.com  with your SJSU email.\\nTypes of Interviews\\nPHONE SCREEN\\nPhone screens are typically 15-30 minutes and include basic questions. The interviewer objective is to verify the information on your resume, determine if you fully understand   the job, and learn about why you want this job. Prepare for a phone screen by finding a quiet place. Demonstrate enthusiasm by varying your voice and minimizing reading off your resume, which can sound overly monotonous. VIDEO INTERVIEW\\nVideo interviews may be used similarly to phone screens to narrow down candidates, particularly if the employer location is not nearby. Prepare for a video interview by finding a quiet, clean, well-lit area. Practice using the technology in advance. Ensure your camera and sound are working correctly. Look at the camera instead of the screen to mimic eye contact.\\n1-ON-1 INTERVIEW\\n1-on-1 interviews are the most common. Ask for the interviewer name and position before  the interview. Search for the interviewer LinkedIn profile to better understand what   the interviewer might be looking for.\\nGROUP INTERVIEW Group interviews consist of one or two interviewers and a larger group of interviewees being interviewed together. This type of interview could be chosen by the employer to save time and to observe how the interviewees interact with each other. Participate and contribute to the discussion without monopolizing the entire conversation. PANEL INTERVIEW Panel interviews consist of multiple interviewers and one interviewee: you. Ask for the interviewers' names and positions before the interview. Greet and shake the hands of all panel members when you enter the room. When responding to questions, start your eye contact with the person who asked the question, then rotate eye contact and conclude your answer with eye contact back on the panel member who asked the question.\",\n",
              "  \"Title: Common Interview Questions\\nDescription: \\nCommon Interview Questions\\nWrite down your responses to the top 10 most commonly asked interview questions.\\n1. Tell me about yourself.\\nTip: You have a short timeframe to answer this question, so don repeat the information on your resume. Instead, focus on your education/degree, key skills, and how your education and experience relate to the qualifications for the job.\\n2. Why do you want to work here?\\nTip: The interviewer wants to see that you studied the job posting, researched the company, and you are genuinely  enthusiastic about the position. Focus on the education and skills you will bring to the company more than what the company will do for you.\\n3. Why should we hire you?\\nTip: This is an opportunity to highlight your key strengths and describe your most memorable selling points for the job. One approach is to mention any unique combination of skills and experience you have that can make you stand out from the other candidates. 4. What is your greatest strength?\\nTip: To prepare your answer, make a list of your top strengths and decide which three are most relevant for the position. Avoid choosing generic strengths that anyone can claim like you're a hard worker or people person. Be specific and prepare an example to demonstrate each strength.\\n5. What is your greatest weakness?\\nTip: Choose a weakness that is not essential to the job requirements. Consider something you have limited knowledge  of, and explain how you are working to improve that knowledge or skill. This allows you to show that you are motivated  to learn and contribute to the company, and you can answer this question in a positive way.\\n\\nCommon Interview Questions (continued)\\n6. What accomplishment are you most proud of and why?\\nTip: Review your resume and use an accomplishment that is relevant to the job. Expand on it and tell a story using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method (for more help, see the Resume Guide ).\\n7. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\\nTip: Think about where this position could realistically take you and how that aligns with some of your broader professional goals. Look at the company team organization and think about how you would like to grow within the company.\\n8. Tell me about a time when you faced a challenge and overcame it.\\nTip: Look at your college projects or jobs, think about a challenging project or situation you encountered and the steps you took to address and resolve it, either by yourself or with a team.\\n9. Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict with a coworker or classmate.\\nTip: Choose a situation in which you found a way to maintain a positive professional relationship. Ideally, this situation allowed you to demonstrate your professionalism, team skills, people skills, and calm under pressure.\\n10. Do you have any questions for me?\\nTip: Ask questions that would help you gain insight for future interviews, such as: What are key skills and qualities you are seeking in a candidate? What do you see as some of the challenges of this position? What do you want the new person to achieve in the first three months on the job? What is the next step in your hiring process?\",\n",
              "  'Title: Types of Questions\\nDescription: \\nBehavioral Questions\\nBehavioral interview questions focus on how you handled various situations in the past. They typically start with Tell me about a time when or Give me an example. When you hear these words, think about your  answer in the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format (for more help, see the Resume Guide ).\\nExamples\\n Tell me about a time when you had dealt with a difficult customer or co-worker. How did you handle the situation?\\n Give an example of a time when you had make a relatively quick decision. What was the decision and what was your thought process behind your choice?\\n Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a high-pressure situation. How did you cope with the stress?\\n Give me an example of a time when you went above and beyond the call of duty to get a job done.\\n Tell me about a time when you had to lead a project or team. What did you learn from that experience?\\n Tell me about a time when your team wasn pulling their weight in a project. How did you handle it?\\nSituational Questions\\nSituational questions are theoretical questions meant to assess your critical thinking skills and gain information about how you make decisions and think through difficult situations.\\nExamples\\n You are given several tasks with competing deadlines. How would you prioritize them?\\n You are working with a client who is making unreasonable demands. How do you respond to them?\\n You disagree with your boss about how to proceed on a project. How would you handle the situation?\\n You are given constructive criticism by your boss, and you disagree with it. How would you address   the situation?\\n If you could have coffee with anyone in history, who would it be and why?\\n\\nDifficult Questions\\nDifficult questions gauge how you respond to situations when you are caught off guard. They can assess  your critical thinking skills, self-awareness, and growth mindset. Don be afraid to ask for a minute to think before answering. For riddles such as How many gas stations are in the U.S.? process your answer out loud. The interviewer is not looking for the correct answer but your critical thinking and problem-solving process.\\nExamples\\n Tell me about a mistake that you made. Looking back, what would you have done differently?\\n What are three things that you think you need to work on?\\n Describe your worst boss.\\n What is one thing that you would change about your last job and why?\\n How many times does a clock hands overlap?\\n If you had one superpower, what would it be and why?\\nIllegal/Improper Questions\\nCertain questions are illegal or improper for interviewers to ask because they can be used to discriminate against candidates based on protected classes (race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin). Salary and criminal history inquiries are banned in California, including on job applications. When facing an illegal/improper question, determine why the interviewer is asking that question, avoid directly answering the question, and turn the conversation to your strengths.\\nExamples\\n Are you married or single?\\n Do you plan to have children in the next year?\\n Do you have a disability?\\n What your race?\\nQuestions to Ask the Interviewer\\nAt the end of every interview, your interviewer will most likely ask if you have any questions they can answer.  It is always a good idea to have some questions prepared to demonstrate your interest in the position. Examples\\n What type of professional development opportunities do you offer your employees?\\n Can you tell me about the training and supervision I will receive during my first year?\\n What potential growth opportunities are available within your company?\\n Can you describe some of the projects and assignments I will be assigned during my first year?\\n What are some of the department/company goals for the upcoming year?\\n What are the biggest challenges that new hires face in their first year?',\n",
              "  \"Title: Interview Etiquette\\nDescription: \\nInterview Etiquette\\nYour positive attitude plays a key role in the interview process and sets the stage for your success. You can have a great resume, college degree, and required skills for the job but, employers are also evaluating how well you fit into the work environment and work with others. Learn how to project a polite and professional appeal.\\nIntroductions\\n Be friendly to all employees the moment you enter the building this is your chance to make a great   first impression!\\n Make sure to look people in the eyes, and smile to seem confident and approachable.\\n Give a firm (but not too firm) handshake.\\nDiscussions\\n Try not to interrupt people in the middle of a story this shows people you value their ideas and company.\\n Don talk too loudly or for too long these actions might make you seem self-centered.\\n Stay away from negative conversations they can build mistrust.\\n If you struggle to come up with conversation topics, equip yourself with conversation starters for example, from watching the news, reading an interesting article, or attending a professional event.\\nBody Language / Non-Verbal Behavior\\n Show that you're focused on the conversation by keeping eye contact, nodding, smiling, and using other nonverbal positive gestures.\\nThank Y ou Notes\\nAfter an interview, job/internship fair, or employer event, always send a thank you email to the person you spoke to. Example\\nDear First Name,\\nThank you very much for the interview yesterday. I wish to reaffirm my strong interest in the position with your organization. As we discussed, I feel that my recent Bachelor degree in Communications, my semester projects, and volunteer experience have provided me with an understanding of business operations which will prove to be an asset to your organization. I have always been considered a dedicated student, hard worker, and dependable team member, and I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your organization. I also enjoyed discussing our shared interest in the local environment and community service. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\\nSincerely,\\nYour First and Last Name\",\n",
              "  'Title: Negotiating Offer\\nDescription: \\nNegotiating an Offer Congratulations! Your hard work has landed you an internship/job offer! Now you get to choose whether  or not to accept the offer and if you should negotiate. Compensation is only one factor in an ideal job offer , though it is often considered the most important. To determine the compensation range for similar roles, check sources such as the SJSU Career Outcomes (First Destination Survey ), the Educate to Career  Job Salary Calculator , Payscale , and Glassdoor .\\nFactors to Consider\\n Benefits:  Does the employer offer medical, dental, and vision? If it does, how much does the employer cover? What options does the employer offer for retirement?\\n Vacation/Sick Time:  How much vacation and sick time will you earn?\\n Location:  How long is the commute? Is there public transit available if needed?\\n Work/Life Balance:  What is the expected work schedule? Does the employer offer telecommuting or flexible work schedules? Will you be an exempt (salaried) or non-exempt (hourly) employee?\\n Professional Development:  Does the employer support professional development opportunities   (i.e., conferences, trainings) or provide financial aid for continuing education?\\n Company Culture:  What is the work environment like? If you conduct salary research and find that the offer is fair, you may accept it. In other instances based on your research, you might decide to negotiate salary and benefits.\\nUnder 2018 California Employment Laws, employers can no longer ask candidates about their salary history . Employers also must provide the pay scale for a position in the job posting. Salary Negotiation Tips\\n Be Reasonable:  Knowing what your employer typically pays, as well as what competitors typically pay ,  will help you appear informed, educated, and ready for discussion.  Be Gracious: If the offer you are given does not fit your desired income, don panic! Keep your demeanor neutral and express gratitude for the offer before jumping into the negotiation. Express confidence in your ability to succeed in the job and provide reasons to support your request such as relevant experience, special skills, or current competing job offers.\\n Be Creative: Examine the compensation packet carefully and don hesitate to ask the HR representative questions about employee benefits such as health insurance, employee wellness programs, vacation, and sick leave.\\nIf it becomes clear that the salary is fixed, be respectful and ask if it would be possible to establish a 90-day evaluation period to re-visit your salary if you meet (better yet exceed) your goals.',\n",
              "  'Title: Accepting Offer\\nDescription: \\nAfter Accepting an Offer\\nOnce you accept a job/internship offer, we recommend you stop applying or interviewing for other roles.  Accepting a job offer means you have officially committed to work for a specific organization. Review our student services and expectations  web page for more information. If there are circumstances in which you  are considering another offer, please schedule an appointment  with your career counselor to talk through your specific situation and the best options to move forward with minimal negative impact on the employer you are working with.\\nKeep in mind the following considerations, tips, and sample language if you decide to move forward with withdrawing an accepted offer.\\nWhat does it mean to renege on accepting a job offer?\\n The act of reneging on an acceptance of a job offer in the job search process happens when a candidate accepts a job or internship offer (verbally or in writing) and then rescinds that acceptance (before starting  or soon after starting).\\n California is an at-will employment state meaning that the employer or the employee can legally terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.\\n Keep in mind, that there are short- and long-term consequences that need to be considered prior to reneging  on an accepted offer.\\nWhy does it happen?\\n The candidate doesn stop interviewing and applying for jobs, even after accepting an offer\\n The candidate receives a better offer from a competing organization\\n Emergency circumstances occur such as a personal illness or needing to care for an ill family member\\n An unexpected move\\nThings to Consider Before You Renege on an Offer\\n It can take a lot of time and resources for a recruiter to interview multiple candidates and decide who will receive the offer. Once a hire is made other candidates are turned down and recruiting stops.\\n When a candidate reneges, the recruiter has to start the hiring process all over again which also leads to the position not being filled for a longer period.\\n When students renege on an offer, it reflects badly on the university, and the recruiter may decide to stop recruiting which affects the whole campus.\\n Even in a large metropolitan area like Silicon Valley, it is not uncommon for professionals in similar industries to be connected. You don want to create a negative reputation for yourself or SJSU as flakey or unreliable.\\nThings to Do Before you Renege on an Offer  Consult with a career counselor  to discuss the situation and how to approach your communication with  the employer.\\n Speak with the hiring manager first to share that you have received a competing offer from another organization, and allow your current employer the chance to counteroffer .\\nUpdated 09092024',\n",

New or Current Students After you have been admitted to SJSU, if you want to change your nonimmigrant status to F-1, we recommend that you plan ahead. Below is a summary of available options. If you are admitted to SJSU in your current nonimmigrant status, such as H-4, F-2, E-2, L-2, etc., it is your responsibility to know if you can study in your current status. See this ICE handout Nonimmigrants: Who Can Study. If you have not been admitted to SJSU, please wait until you have been officially accepted by the University and received your admit letter before applying for a change of status. ISSS does not provide admission counseling or advice. Per University policy, non-resident tuition fees are charged from the I-20 issuance date. Ways to obtain F-1 status. View this Comparison Chart. By Travel or Consular processing. You will need to depart the U.S., apply for an F-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, preferably in your home country. Fill out and submit a Change of Status I-20 Request form to ISSS. Apply for an F-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad. To re-enter the U.S. apply for F-1 admission at a U.S. Port of Entry. You will need to enter within 30 days of the program start date listed on your I-20. File Form I-539, Change of Status application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Fill out and submit a Change of Status I-20 Request form to ISSS. Prepare and submit your Form I-539 COS application to USCIS along with a copy of the COS I-20 and supporting documentation. See USCIS or Study in the States website for more COS to F-1 information. Check USCIS Processing Time for Form I-539s here. Students filing a COS application with USCIS have the option to file for Premium Processing at the time of application or by adding it to their pending application (by filing the I-907). USCIS will take adjudicative action within 30 days or will refund Premium Processing fee. Processing Time Questions to consider: How soon do you want to become an F-1 student? When did you start your academic program? Are you in the first semester of your degree program or near the end of your program? Changing your nonimmigrant status to F-1 status will take time. Depending on the route you select, you will need to plan ahead. Expect delays either with obtaining your F-1 visa stamp, or you may experience prolonged COS processing times with USCIS. ISSS highly recommends that you start the change of status process early in your academic career, optimally with at least two semesters or more remaining in your degree program. Financial implications. Are you currently eligible for in-state tuition or have an exemption/exception to payment of non-resident tuition? All F-1 students pay the non-resident tuition rate. Per University policy, non-resident tuition fees are charged from the I-20 issuance date. In addition, F-1 students are required to purchase University-sponsored health insurance. You will need to factor in any travel costs in and out of the U.S. and visa application fee(s) if you choose the consular processing option. Alternatively, if you choose the USCIS option, consider the filing fee for Form I-539 Change of Status, plus biometrics, or additional fee(s). Intent or Motivation. Are you willing to pursue full-time studies? F-1 students are required to be enrolled in a full course of study during the academic year. Off-campus work benefits such as Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical Training are not guaranteed and should not be the primary reason(s) for you to convert to F-1 student status. Application Steps Fill out and submit a Change of Status I-20 Request form to ISSS. Indicate which option you will pursue to convert to F-1 status. Allow at least 15 business days for processing. We will contact you when the I-20 is ready. Financial documentation See the Declaration of Finance form for the required funding amounts and acceptable funding sources. Bank letters or statements must be dated within the past six months, must be in English, balance listed in U.S. dollars. For the USCIS COS application, we recommend you submit additional 3-4 consecutive bank statements with a monthly balance in the required amount. Current immigration documents Copy of your passport, visa, and I-94 record of arrival Copy of the principal visa holder passport, visa, I-94, or Form I-797A Notice of Action, if applicable Admit Letter If you have already started your studies at SJSU, provide a letter from your graduate advisor or an individualized academic or program plan with the expected graduation or degree completion date. This will determine your I-20 program end date. After you have received your I-20, check for any errors, sign, and date the document. Prepare and gather your remaining paperwork depending on the option below: Checklist for Consular Processing Checklist for USCIS Change of Status Deadline to request an I-20. No matter which option you choose, understand that converting to F-1 student status takes time. There are many steps for you to complete. Commit to one option. Plan ahead. Expect travel or visa application-related delays or longer processing times at USCIS. ISSS cannot guarantee you an F-1 visa or a change of status to F-1 approval within your preferred timeline. You must maintain your current nonimmigrant status to be eligible to remain in the U.S. Have a contingency plan in the event that your change of status or your F-1 visa is not approved. Requested F-1 Start Date Fall Semester No later than July 15 Spring Semester No later than December 15 Employment If you are interested in learning about the employment options available to F-1 students, select On-Campus, Curricular Practical Training, or Optional Practical Training under the Current Students tab on the ISSS website. Keep in mind that you must be in valid F-1 status to benefit from the employment options for students. For off-campus employment (CPT, OPT) there is the additional requirement of completing one academic year of full-time studies. Please refrain from inquiring about CPT or OPT work authorization or be in the process of applying for jobs if you do not have the proper F-1 status yet.',\n",

For example, one way to network is to reach out to alumni through LinkedIn and set up an informational interview with a professional in your career field of interest.\\nMYTH #2: Networking should start when you are looking for a job/internship.\\nNetworking takes time and requires follow up. Don wait until you need a job/internship to start networking because this often appears disingenuous. Start building your network early on by showing a genuine interest in learning about your industry.\\nMYTH #3: The main goal of networking is to get me a referral for a job/internship.\\nNetworking is a great way to gain industry knowledge, find mentors, and grow professionally . While getting a referral for a job/internship is certainly very helpful, it should not be your number one goal. So get out there and start networking!

              "  'Title: Resume-International\\nDescription: Resume\\nStart by reviewing our Resume/Cover Letter Guide . Note key differences between a US resume and a resume in another country:\\n A US resume is a one page summary that highlights relevant skills and experience based on the job description. Resumes are different from CVs, which are used more often internationally . A CV is longer than one page and is a static document that includes an extensive history of your education and experience. In the US, CVs are typically only used for research or academic positions.\\n Do not include personal information such as age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, or immigration status. Also do not include a photo or test scores (such as TOEFL).\\nHere are some top tips to making your resume stand out:\\n Check for spelling/grammar mistakes. You can get help with writing at the SJSU Writing Center .\\n Keep your resume to 1-2 pages. Do not try to squeeze as much information in as possible, as this makes it difficult for the recruiter to scan. If you have additional experience that does not fit, include it on your LinkedIn profile.\\n Describe your accomplishments. Replace passive phrases such as responsible for with strong action verbs such as led, managed, and collaborated. Quantify your resumes to show the impact of your work.\\n Include links to your LinkedIn, website, and/or GitHub account. Use these sites to showcase examples of projects and proof of your work.\\n Demonstrate both technical skills and transferable skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and leadership.\\n Don focus on just academics.  Include experiences outside the classroom such as involvement in student organizations or volunteer work.\\n Provide a frame of reference for experience outside of the US. For example, interned at the #3 fastest growing company in India.',\n",

It will help you review , practice, and record hundreds of practice interview questions from various industries. Register at sjsu.biginterview.com  with your SJSU email.\\nTypes of Interviews\\nPHONE SCREEN\\nPhone screens are typically 15-30 minutes and include basic questions. The interviewer objective is to verify the information on your resume, determine if you fully understand   the job, and learn about why you want this job. Prepare for a phone screen by finding a quiet place. Demonstrate enthusiasm by varying your voice and minimizing reading off your resume, which can sound overly monotonous. VIDEO INTERVIEW\\nVideo interviews may be used similarly to phone screens to narrow down candidates, particularly if the employer location is not nearby. Prepare for a video interview by finding a quiet, clean, well-lit area. Practice using the technology in advance. Ensure your camera and sound are working correctly. Look at the camera instead of the screen to mimic eye contact.\\n1-ON-1 INTERVIEW\\n1-on-1 interviews are the most common. Ask for the interviewer name and position before  the interview. Search for the interviewer LinkedIn profile to better understand what   the interviewer might be looking for.\\nGROUP INTERVIEW Group interviews consist of one or two interviewers and a larger group of interviewees being interviewed together. This type of interview could be chosen by the employer to save time and to observe how the interviewees interact with each other. Participate and contribute to the discussion without monopolizing the entire conversation. PANEL INTERVIEW Panel interviews consist of multiple interviewers and one interviewee: you. Ask for the interviewers' names and positions before the interview. Greet and shake the hands of all panel members when you enter the room. When responding to questions, start your eye contact with the person who asked the question, then rotate eye contact and conclude your answer with eye contact back on the panel member who asked the question.\",\n",

Focus on the education and skills you will bring to the company more than what the company will do for you.\\n3. Why should we hire you?\\nTip: This is an opportunity to highlight your key strengths and describe your most memorable selling points for the job. One approach is to mention any unique combination of skills and experience you have that can make you stand out from the other candidates. 4. What is your greatest strength?\\nTip: To prepare your answer, make a list of your top strengths and decide which three are most relevant for the position. Avoid choosing generic strengths that anyone can claim like you're a hard worker or people person. Be specific and prepare an example to demonstrate each strength.\\n5. What is your greatest weakness?\\nTip: Choose a weakness that is not essential to the job requirements. Consider something you have limited knowledge  of, and explain how you are working to improve that knowledge or skill. This allows you to show that you are motivated  to learn and contribute to the company, and you can answer this question in a positive way.\\n\\nCommon Interview Questions (continued)\\n6.

They can assess  your critical thinking skills, self-awareness, and growth mindset. Don be afraid to ask for a minute to think before answering. For riddles such as How many gas stations are in the U.S.? process your answer out loud. The interviewer is not looking for the correct answer but your critical thinking and problem-solving process.\\nExamples\\n Tell me about a mistake that you made.

Salary and criminal history inquiries are banned in California, including on job applications. When facing an illegal/improper question, determine why the interviewer is asking that question, avoid directly answering the question, and turn the conversation to your strengths.\\nExamples\\n Are you married or single?\\n Do you plan to have children in the next year?\\n Do you have a disability?\\n What your race?\\nQuestions to Ask the Interviewer\\nAt the end of every interview, your interviewer will most likely ask if you have any questions they can answer.  It is always a good idea to have some questions prepared to demonstrate your interest in the position. Examples\\n What type of professional development opportunities do you offer your employees?\\n Can you tell me about the training and supervision I will receive during my first year?\\n What potential growth opportunities are available within your company?\\n Can you describe some of the projects and assignments I will be assigned during my first year?\\n What are some of the department/company goals for the upcoming year?\\n What are the biggest challenges that new hires face in their first year?',\n",

If there are circumstances in which you  are considering another offer, please schedule an appointment  with your career counselor to talk through your specific situation and the best options to move forward with minimal negative impact on the employer you are working with.\\nKeep in mind the following considerations, tips, and sample language if you decide to move forward with withdrawing an accepted offer.\\nWhat does it mean to renege on accepting a job offer?\\n The act of reneging on an acceptance of a job offer in the job search process happens when a candidate accepts a job or internship offer (verbally or in writing) and then rescinds that acceptance (before starting  or soon after starting).\\n California is an at-will employment state meaning that the employer or the employee can legally terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.\\n Keep in mind, that there are short- and long-term consequences that need to be considered prior to reneging  on an accepted offer.\\nWhy does it happen?\\n The candidate doesn stop interviewing and applying for jobs, even after accepting an offer\\n The candidate receives a better offer from a competing organization\\n Emergency circumstances occur such as a personal illness or needing to care for an ill family member\\n An unexpected move\\nThings to Consider Before You Renege on an Offer\\n It can take a lot of time and resources for a recruiter to interview multiple candidates and decide who will receive the offer. Once a hire is made other candidates are turned down and recruiting stops.\\n When a candidate reneges, the recruiter has to start the hiring process all over again which also leads to the position not being filled for a longer period.\\n When students renege on an offer, it reflects badly on the university, and the recruiter may decide to stop recruiting which affects the whole campus.\\n Even in a large metropolitan area like Silicon Valley, it is not uncommon for professionals in similar industries to be connected. You don want to create a negative reputation for yourself or SJSU as flakey or unreliable.\\nThings to Do Before you Renege on an Offer  Consult with a career counselor  to discuss the situation and how to approach your communication with  the employer.\\n Speak with the hiring manager first to share that you have received a competing offer from another organization, and allow your current employer the chance to counteroffer .\\nUpdated 09092024',\n",
