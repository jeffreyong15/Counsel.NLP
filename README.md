# Counsel.NLP

Smart Academic Advisor 

CMPE 295A/B Project

## Introduction
Counsel.NLP is a Smart Academic Advising Chatbot centered to advise students in the College of Engineering at San Jose State Univeristy. The project refers to previous academic papers similar in topic and implementation. Links to the academic papers are located at the bottom of this document.

## Baselines
In order to compare our performance metrics with others previously implemented, we replicated two academic papers who applied different methods to designing a Chatbot for academic purposes. Mock student data was created and was used to train the models implemented

**KNN & Naive Bayes**

KNN & Naive Bayes was the first baseline achieving a respective accuracy of 70% & 73%. As noted in the image below [In Progress], the precesion is where they differ as we can see Naive Bayes maintains a higher score in comparison to KNN. In regards to response time, we see the latter is quick to respond in comparison to the former.
